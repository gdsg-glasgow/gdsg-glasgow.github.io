I am an interdisciplinary researcher, with a background in geography, economic history, digital humanities, and economics. Currently, I am working on the mathematics of cities with a particular emphasis on minority groups. My broader interests relate to the evolution of city systems over time, mathematical and statistical modelling, and economic development.

I previously held academic positions at The Alan Turing Institute and The Open University, before joining the University of Glasgow in 2023. I earned my PhD from the University of Exeter in 2020, where I also gained my MRes. I also hold an MSc (by research) from the University of York, and BA (Hons.) from the University of Oxford.
