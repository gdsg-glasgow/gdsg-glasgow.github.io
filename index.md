# The Geospatial Data Science Group

The Geospatial Data Science Group at the University of Glasgow sits at the intersection between data science and geospatial data. We explore, analyse, model, and infer from geospatial data to design, develop and deliver tools and knowledge to help achieve a smarter, faster, fairer and more inclusive society.
